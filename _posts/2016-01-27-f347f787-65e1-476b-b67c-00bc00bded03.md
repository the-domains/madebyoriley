Glass Heart 

Handmade luxury soap ![](https://img1.etsystatic.com/132/0/11348819/il_570xN.887050703_o407.jpg)

Can ship directly to your Valentine, anonymously or with a note from you.

This soap is loud with color and quietly unscented.

While you may think it is a tad quirky design, it is handmade with these nourishing ingredients for your skin:

Goats Milk is packed full of essential nutrients and vitamins like vitamin D, C, B1, B6, B12, and E, that feed the skin and are absorbed into the body.

Glycerin is called a humectant, meaning that it attracts water. When glycerin is applied to the skin, it helps maintain the skin's water balance on an intercellular level.

Lemon Essential Oil is astringent and detoxifying in nature and its antiseptic properties help in treating pimples and various skin disorders.

Each bar is $6.00 and weighs 4.5 ounces.

Size: 3.5" x 2.5" x 1"
