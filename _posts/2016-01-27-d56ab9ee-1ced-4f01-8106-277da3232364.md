Filled with natural goodness: Coconut Milk, Aloe Vera Oil, Olive Oil, Frankincense Essential Oil and Lavender Essential Oil.

As well as truly cleaning with ingredients with anti-bacterial properties this soap will also leave your skin feeling good, not dried out as with a commercial soap.

Each bar is $4.00 and weighs 3 ounces.

Size: 3-7/16" x 1-7/16" x 7/16"
