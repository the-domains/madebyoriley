![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4379887c-1a29-4371-8670-2739cebb5634.jpg)

Luxury handmade soap.

These bars of soap look like your love has been carved in white marble. Can ship directly to your Valentine, anonymously or with a note from you.

Filled with natural goodness: Coconut Milk, Aloe Vera Oil, Olive Oil, Frankincense Essential Oil and Lavender Essential Oil.

As well as truly cleaning with ingredients with anti-bacterial properties this soap will also leave your skin feeling good, not dried out as with a commercial soap.

Each bar is $4.00 and weighs 3 ounces.

Size: 3-7/16" x 1-7/16" x 7/16"
