These elegant bars of soap look like your love has been carved in white marble. 

We can ship directly to your Valentine, anonymously or with a personal note from you printed on linen finish note paper.

Each luxury bar is filled with natural goodness: Coconut Milk, Aloe Vera Oil, Olive Oil, Frankincense Essential Oil and Lavender Essential Oil.

As well as truly cleaning your skin with ingredients with anti-bacterial properties, this soap will also leave your skin feeling soft and nourished.

Each bar is $4.00 and weighs 3 ounces.
