Scroll Work Hearts - Handmade luxury soaps 

make a unique and personal gift, especially on **Valentine's Day**, for that special girl in your life.
![](https://img1.etsystatic.com/069/0/11348819/il_570xN.806903281_p9ix.jpg)

Can ship directly to your Valentine, anonymously or with a note from you.

These beautifully detailed scroll work heart soaps are sold in a bag of 5 individual hearts. Ideal as travel or guest soaps or as party favors for other events in her life.

They smell divine and are handmade with nourishing natural ingredients.

Just under one ounce net weight each, 2.5" wide by 2.25" long, they are small and delicate. 

Price is $6.00 for a pack of 5 soaps.

Custom orders are also available to match her favorite color, or her preference for any shower party theme, including combinations of different colored hearts.

Delivery time on custom orders is 2-3 weeks as soap needs time to cure before they are ready to be shipped.
